## Blog

I have a [blog](skyspace) which consists of notes from various math problems that I think about and also some contemplations on life.  
Here are some of the best posts:

- [hashing](https://awestover.github.io/skyspace/posts/thoughts/06-24-23.html): Contemplations on what I enjoy about research.
- [Truth](https://awestover.github.io/skyspace/posts/thoughts/01-21-24.html): Contemplations on the importance of "working out the details carefully" in math.
- [Girth](https://awestover.github.io/skyspace/posts/cool-algorithms/12-09-23.html): Some notes I took while reading literature on girth for a research project.
- [Sketching](https://awestover.github.io/skyspace/posts/randomized-algorithms/11-24-23.html): Notes on Sketching Algorithms, presented through dialogue of occasionally recurring characters of the blog.
- [k-server on a circle](https://awestover.github.io/skyspace/posts/cool-algorithms/07-26-23.html): Attempting to solve a problem I read about in a paper.
- [simply periodic binary functions](https://awestover.github.io/skyspace/posts/number-theory/05-29-23.html): A neat number-theoretic bijection.
